### ***Description:***
* This is a website for a property owner or multihome renter. The goal is to have a spot online to keep notes on properties and each sort of task needed at each.
* The project currently runs locally, with a goal of having it be deployed through Heroku so that tasks can be updated or looked at on the go.
* This is the product of two months of learning how to code. Thank you for reading this far!
  
### ***Technologies Used:***
1. React
2. JavaScript/HTML/CSS
3. ~~MongoDB~~
4. ~~Heroku~~

### ***Getting Started***
To run this locally, clone this to your repo to your local machine. CD into the backEnd, and run "npm start" or a similar command to start the backend server. Repeat in similarly in frontEnd to start the front end server. Having both local 3000, and local 3001 running, the website will open in your browser.
